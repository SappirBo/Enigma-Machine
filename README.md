# Enigma-Machine
The Enigma machine is a famous encryption device used by the Germans, most notably during World War II, for securing military communications. The machine resembles a typewriter and operates by inputting letters through a keyboard, which are then encrypted based on the configuration of several rotors and a plugboard before being output as a different letter.<br/>
This setup allowed for a vast number of possible settings, making the Enigma's encryption extremely difficult to break.
## Overview

## How it works?

* Rotors
  * Rotor mechanism
* Reflector 
* Plugboard
* Machine Settings

## Combination
1. Rotors: 5 * 4 * 3 = 60.
2. Starting: 26^3 = 17,576.
3. Plugboard: 26! / (6! * 10! * 2^10) = 150,738,274,237,937,250.
4. Total: 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.

Means that there are more then **158 Quintillion** ways to set up the Enigma Machine!
